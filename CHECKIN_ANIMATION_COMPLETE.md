# ‚úÖ Check-In Animation Feature Complete

## What's Been Implemented:

### 1. **Success UI Popup** (replaces alert)
- When check-in succeeds, a beautiful animated popup appears
- Green gradient background with checkmark icon
- Shows success message with animation
- Auto-dismisses after 2 seconds

### 2. **Smooth Card Removal Animation**
- When check-in succeeds, the class card slides up and fades out
- Smooth scale-down effect for better UX
- Card is removed from the stack after animation completes
- Next card automatically comes to the top

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- No more alert dialogs
- Custom success UI with animations
- Smooth transitions throughout

## How It Works:

1. User clicks "Check-in" button on a class
2. API call to Flask backend with location check
3. If successful:
   - ‚úÖ Success popup appears (animated)
   - üé¨ Class card starts sliding up animation
   - ‚è±Ô∏è After 2 seconds: card is removed from the list
   - üì± Next class automatically appears at the top

## Key Changes:

### LandingPage.jsx
- Added `checkInSuccess` state for popup management
- Success UI overlay component
- Automatic class removal after successful check-in

### StackedClassCard.jsx
- Accepts `removingId` prop to trigger animation
- Slide-up animation: `-translate-y-32 opacity-0 scale-95`
- Smooth 1 second transition

### index.css
- Added `animate-scale-in` animation for popup
- Smooth scale-in effect

## Test It:

1. Start Flask server (port 5001)
2. Start React app
3. Upload ICS file with classes
4. Click "Check-in" on any class
5. Watch the animation! üéâ
