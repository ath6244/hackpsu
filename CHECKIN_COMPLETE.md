# ✅ Check-In Feature - COMPLETE

## What's Been Done:

1. ✅ **Check-in button appears for ALL expanded classes** (removed the "current/upcoming" restriction)
2. ✅ **Flask backend** running on port 5001 (avoiding macOS AirPlay port conflict)
3. ✅ **Attendance tracking** integrated - checks if user is within 100m radius
4. ✅ **React frontend** makes API calls to Flask backend

## Current Status:

- **Flask Server**: Running on `http://localhost:5001`
- **React App**: Should be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar)
- **Check-in Button**: Now visible for ANY class when the card is expanded

## How to Use:

1. **Start Flask** (already running):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/anuroopsaini/Documents/hackpsu
   source venv/bin/activate
   python app.py  # Runs on port 5001
   ```

2. **Start React** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd hackpsu
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Use the App**:
   - Upload your ICS file to get classes loaded
   - Click on any class card to expand it
   - You'll see a **"Check-in"** button
   - Click it to verify your location within 100m of the class

## How It Works:

1. User clicks "Check-in" button
2. React sends `POST` request to `http://localhost:5001/api/check-in`
3. Flask backend:
   - Gets current user location (demo: ECore Building coordinates)
   - Checks distance to class location using geopy.geodesic
   - Returns success if within 100m, failure otherwise
4. User sees alert with result

## Demo Location:
- User is simulated at: `(40.798404, -77.8605)` - ECore Building
- Geofence radius: **100 meters**

## Test API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/check-in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"classData": {"courseCode": "TEST", "location": "ECore Building, Penn State University, University Park, PA"}}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "distance": 0.0,
  "message": "Check-in successful! You are 0.0m from ECore Building..."
}
```
